		<h3>Blaise Pascal: A Brief Biography</h3>
		<div id="bio">
			<p>Blaise Pascal was a heavily influential figure during the French  Classical
				Period in the mid-seventeenth century. He was passionate enough to pursue 
				and write on topics ranging from geometry, statistics, fluid mechanics, 
				and religion. Much of his work laid the foundation of several fields 
				including probability theory, hydrodynamics, and mechanical calculation. 
				Although he lived a relative short life, he filled it with a grand pursuit 
				of knowledge that still resonates in many fields today.</p>
			<p>Pascal was born in Clermont, France on June 19th, 1623. He was educated and 
				raised by his father, a local judge, due to the passing of his mother when 
				he was just three years old. From a young age he struggled with health 
				issues and this would be a constant theme throughout his life. Despite 
				these struggles, he gained early fame and notoriety for his research into 
				projective geometry at only sixteen years old. This research was picked up 
				by future mathematicians in the nineteenth century and led to the 
				&#39;completed&#39; Pascal Mysticum in 1849. The first published diagram of this 
				completed mysticum didn&#39;t appear until 1921 and was hand drawn. This 
				mysticum in geometry shows how much his work could influence future	
				generations of incredible thinkers.</p>
			<p>His work on probability and game theory did not disappoint either. It was 
				said that his initial endeavors into probability resulted from a friend 
				gifting him a puzzle. Intrigued by it, this led him to try and understand 
				other games mathematically. There was one problem that stood out to him. 
				If two people are playing a winner-take-all dice game, but they get	
				interrupted and must stop before finishing, how can you calculate how to 
				split the rest of the pot? In 1654, he delved into the question with 
				fellow mathematician Pierre de Fermat and this joint-pursuit led to the 
				foundation of mathematical probability. Their work was monumental in the 
				understanding of game theory and statistics. </p>
			<p>Pascal also contributed to the physical sciences through his study on 
				hydrodynamics. His research led him to the one of his most famous and 
				lasting discoveries, Pascal&#39;s principle. This principle stated that 
				regardless of where a pressure is applied to a fluid, that pressure will 
				be equally transferred to a fluid so long as it is confined and at rest. 
				This had lasting implications and led to the unit of pressure, pascals, to 
				be named after him. His studies also led him to invent both the hydraulic 
				press and the syringe. He was also fascinated with vacuums being created 
				as the result of hydrostatic pressure, and this happened to be a rather 
				controversial topic for the time. His thorough love and talent in this	
				field and such a wide range of others continues to show the lasting impact 
				Pascal has had on several aspects of the sciences.</p>
			<p>While he was still a teenager, Pascal wanted to create a machine that could 
				do arithmetic. This idea led to his invention of the calculator, and one 
				of the closest things to a first computer. He tried to perfect it over 
				several years and multiple failures, but he completed the calculator, 
				known then as the Pascaline, with a few different designs.</p>
			<p>Later in his life, Pascal began to pursue religion as a form of 
				self-fulfillment both spiritual and intellectually. He wrote numerous works 
				on theology, his most prominent, yet unfinished, being The Pensees. It was 
				said that his spontaneous theological intrigue was sparked by a religious 
				vision which Pascal documented in the Memorial. Some scholars dispute this 
				and attribute it to a near-death experience, but not too much information 
				seems to exist on the origins. Regardless of how Pascal&#39;s pursuit of 
				religious enlightenment began, it is evident that he was deeply moved and 
				motivated through his lasting works on theology and ethics. His religious 
				views can be summarized by his response to a doctor trying to give him 
				medicine stating simply that &#34;Sickness is the natural state of 
				Christians.&#34; implying that you must also suffer to be able to feel joy.</p>
			<p>His constant state of poor health had finally caught up with him and he 
				passed in Paris in August of 1662. Pascal&#39;s varying contributions to the 
				several fields mentioned has helped	maintain his legacy throughout the past 
				few centuries. He both made crucial advancements for his time that also 
				laid the groundwork for advancements in the following centuries. Pascal was 
				an inventor, a scientist, an author, a preacher, a mathematician, an 
				economist, and a devout man. Although he died at thirty-nine, he lived a 
				full and diverse life.</p>
